# youtube2spotify

This gets the songs from a youtube playlist and adds them to a spotify playlist (accuracy is below 100% ;D)

All you need to do is add the youtube and spotify API keys, and the ids of the playlists.

Youtube API:
https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3

Spotify API:
https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/
